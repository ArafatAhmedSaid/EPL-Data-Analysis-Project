1.	Project Title:

English Premier League (EPL) Match Data Analysis.

2.	Problem Statement / Objective:

Football match data contains a lot of information such as goals scored, match results, fouls, and disciplinary actions. However, this data is usually stored in raw formats that are difficult to understand and analyze without proper tools. Coaches, analysts, and football fans often need clear insights to understand team performance, compare teams, and identify trends throughout the season. Without proper data organization and analysis, it becomes hard to extract meaningful information that can support decision-making or performance evaluation.
This project aims to solve this problem by organizing English Premier League (EPL) match data into a structured database and analyzing it using SQL. By querying the data and presenting it visually, the project transforms raw football data into clear and understandable insights that can be easily interpreted.
I chose this project because I am a football fan especially the EPL which is popular. The project also allows me to practice SQL, Big Query, and Tableau together.

3.	Outcome/Deliverables:

•	A well-structured database containing EPL match data.

•	SQL queries that answer important football-related questions

•	Clear visual dashboard showing trends and patterns.

•	Simple explanations of insights derived from the data.

4.	Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing English Premier League (EPL) match data from the 2021–2022 season using SQL, BigQuery, and Tableau. The main objective is to clean, organize, and analyze football match data in order to understand match outcomes, goal-scoring patterns, team performance, and discipline statistics such as fouls and cards. The project will begin by structuring the raw dataset into a relational database and loading it into BigQuery for efficient querying.
SQL queries will then be used to answer key football-related questions, such as which teams performed best, how home and away performances differ, and how discipline impacts match results. Finally, the results of the analysis will be visualized using Tableau dashboards, making the insights easy to understand and communicate.

5.	Tools & Technologies Used:

•	SQL – for database design and querying.

•	BigQuery – for cloud-based data storage and analysis

•	Tableau – for data visualization and dashboards

•	CSV Dataset – English Premier League Match Data (2021–2022)
